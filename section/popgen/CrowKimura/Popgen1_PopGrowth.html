					<h1>Models of Population Growth</h1>
				</section>
				<section id="Discretepop">
					<h2>Model 1: Discrete, nonoverlapping generations</h2>

					<p>
						This model is the simplest description of population growth. The
						basic assumption is that parental reproduction stops before
						offspring reach adulthood. Time is measured most conveniently in
						units of generations. This model best describes annual plants, but
						can be an acceptable first approximation for more complex systems.
						Its greatest strength is its simplicity. \( N_t \) is the number of
						individuals at time \( t \), measured in generations. If the average
						number of progeny per individual is \( w \), the population number
						in generation \( t \) is expressed in terms of the previous
						generation, \( t - 1 \), as:
					</p>

					<p>\[ N_t = w \cdot N_{t-1} \]</p>

					<p>
						As now becomes clear, \( w \) is a measure of both survival and
						reproduction. Individuals who do not survive to reproduce are
						counted as leaving no progeny. Thus, \( w \) is called Darwinian
						fitness, or simply fitness. It is convenient to count the population
						as zygotes, so that the survival and reproduction of an individual
						occur within the same generation.
					</p>

					<p>\[ N_t = w(w \cdot N_{t-2}) = w^2 \cdot N_{t-2} \]</p>

					<p>We can generalize:</p>

					<p>\[ N_t = N_0 \cdot w^t \]</p>

					<p>If we consider that,</p>

					<p>\[ w = 1 + s \]</p>

					<p>
						Where \( s \) is equivalent to an interest rate. Thus, if \( w > 1
						\) or \( s > 0 \), the population increases. Alternatively, if \( w
						< 1 \) or \( s < 0 \), the population will decrease.
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ \begin{align} N_{t+1} &= w \cdot N_t \\ &= (1 + s) \cdot N_t \\
						&= N_t + s \cdot N_t \\ N_{t+1} - N_t &= s \cdot N_t \\ \Delta N_t
						&= s \cdot N_t \end{align} \]
					</p>

					<p>Thus,</p>

					<p>\[ \frac{\Delta N_t}{N_t} = s \]</p>

					<p>
						The proportion by which the population changes in one generation is
						given by \( s \). If the population is composed of several kinds of
						individuals (many genotypes) with different fitnesses, then the
						whole population increases or decreases at the same rate as if all
						the individuals had the average fitness. Consider that \( n_1, n_2,
						n_3, \ldots, n_k \) is the number of each of the \( k \) types in
						the population in generation \( t-1 \). Then, let \( w_1, w_2, w_3,
						\ldots, w_k \) be their respective fitnesses, and assume \( n_1 +
						n_2 + \ldots + n_k = N \).
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ \begin{align} \bar{w} &= \frac{n_1 w_1 + n_2 w_2 + \ldots + n_k
						w_k}{n_1 + n_2 + \ldots + n_k} \\ &= \frac{\sum n_i w_i}{N_{t-1}} \\
						&= \frac{\sum n_i w_i}{\sum n_i} \end{align} \]
					</p>

					<p>Considering that at any given time,</p>

					<p>\[ N_t = n_1 w_1 + n_2 w_2 + \ldots + n_k w_k = \sum n_i w_i \]</p>

					<p>Then,</p>

					<p>\[ N_t = \bar{w} \cdot N_{t-1} \]</p>

					<p>
						The implications are simple: as the fitnesses of the different types
						are inherited, those with greater fitness will be represented in
						greater proportion in the next generation. Hence, \( \bar{w} \) is
						expected to change as the most fit individuals increase in
						proportion. <strong>To summarize:</strong> with a discrete
						generation model and variable fitnesses, the weighted arithmetic
						mean is appropriate for comparing contemporaneous differences, while
						the geometric mean is appropriate for averaging across generations.

					<h2>Model 2: Continuous Random Birth and Deaths</h2>

					<p>
						In this model, we regard the population number \( N_t \) at time \(
						t \) as being very large. In an infinitesimal time interval \(
						\Delta t \), a fraction \( b \cdot \Delta t \) produce offspring and
						a fraction \( d \cdot \Delta t \) die. Thus, the change in
						population number during this interval is:
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ \begin{align} \Delta N_t &= (b - d) \cdot N_t \cdot \Delta t \\
						\Delta N_t &= m \cdot N_t \cdot \Delta t \end{align} \]
					</p>

					<p>
						Where \( m = b - d \), and as \( \Delta t \rightarrow 0 \), we get:
					</p>

					<p>\[ \frac{dN_t}{dt} = m \cdot N_t \]</p>

					<p>In integrated form:</p>

					<p>\[ mt = \log_e N_t - \log_e N_0 \]</p>

					<p>or</p>

					<p>\[ N_t = N_0 \cdot e^{mt} \]</p>

					<p>
						This can be measured in any convenient units such as hours, days,
						weeks, or years. In any case, \( m \) is measured in the reciprocal
						of those same units (per hour, per day, etc.). In its strictest
						form, this model applies only to situations like bacterial growth in
						an unrestricted environment. Each individual is equally likely to
						die or reproduce at any instant. However, most populations do not
						grow or decline rapidly. The age distribution is often near
						equilibrium, making the average birth and death rates nearly
						constant. We find that Equations 1.1 and 1.3 are correspondent in:
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ \begin{align} N_t &= w \cdot N_{t-1} \\ w \cdot N_0 &= N_0 \cdot
						e^{m} \\ w &= e^{mt} \\ m &= \log_e w \end{align} \]
					</p>

					<p>
						If the time unit is chosen so that \( m = \log_e w \), then
						continuous population changes, when counted at time intervals
						corresponding to these units, match the numbers in the discrete
						population. Measuring time in such units makes \( t \) effectively
						equivalent to the number of generations in a discrete model. If \( w
						\) is nearly 1 (i.e., \( s \) is small), then \( \log_e(1 + s)
						\approx s \). Thus, for very slow changes, \( s \) and \( m \) are
						approximately equal. Consider a discrete population that reproduces
						once each year, each parent giving rise to two progeny and dying
						immediately after. Thus, \( \bar{w} = 2 \), and the population
						doubles each year:
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ \begin{align} N_t &= 2 \cdot N_{t-1} \\ N_t &= N_0 \cdot 2^t
						\end{align} \]
					</p>

					<p>
						A second population grows continuously at a rate that also doubles
						the population in one year. Then \( N_t = N_0 \cdot 2^t \), and
						since \( e^m = 2 \), we have \( m = \log_e 2 = 0.693 \), so:
					</p>

					<p>\[ N_t = N_0 \cdot e^{0.693 \cdot t} \]</p>

					<p>
						A third population grows continuously with a growth rate equivalent
						to 100% interest compounded continuously. That is, \( m = 1 \) and:
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ \frac{dN_t}{dt} = N_t \quad \Rightarrow \quad N_t = N_0 \cdot e^t
						\]
					</p>

					<p>
						Each year, the population increases by a factor of \( e = 2.71 \).

					<p>
						We shall call <span>\( w \)</span> the <strong>fitness</strong> or
						the <em>Wrightian fitness</em>, after Sewall Wright. R. A. Fisher
						designated <span>\( m \)</span> as the
						<em>Malthusian parameter</em>. Although used here as measures of the
						absolute rate of increase, <span>\( w \)</span> and
						<span>\( m \)</span> are also used for the
						<em>relative rates</em> of different types. Notice that if there are
						no births, we can rewrite the equation simply as:
					</p>

					<p>\[ dN_t = \hat{d} \cdot N_t \, dt \]</p>

					<p>Which, on integration, is:</p>

					<p>\[ N_t = N_0 \cdot e^{\hat{d} t} \]</p>
					<div
						id="Decay"
						style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px; margin: auto"
					></div>

					<p>
						Hence the life expectancy curve is exponential, with each survival
						having a constant probability of surviving for another time unit. If
						there are different fitness values for different types in the
						population, then:
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ \frac{dN}{dt} = m_1 n_1 + m_2 n_2 + \dots + m_k n_k \] \[
						\frac{dN}{dt} = \bar{m} N \] where \[ \bar{m} = \frac{\sum n_i
						m_i}{\sum n_i} = \frac{\sum n_i m_i}{N} \]
					</p>

					<p>
						As with \( w \) in the discrete model, it is appropriate to replace
						\( m \) with the weighted average of the \( m \)'s in the
						population. When \( \bar{m} \) varies over time, we can break time
						into \( k \) intervals of length \( \Delta t \), during each of
						which \( \bar{m} \) is different:
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ N_t = N_0 (e^{\bar{m}_1 \Delta t_1})(e^{\bar{m}_2 \Delta t_2})
						\dots (e^{\bar{m}_k \Delta t_k}) \] \[ N_t = e^{\bar{m}_1 \Delta t_1
						+ \bar{m}_2 \Delta t_2 + \dots + \bar{m}_k \Delta t_k} \] \[ N_t =
						N_0 e^{\bar{m} t} \] where \[ \bar{m} = \frac{\sum \Delta t_i
						\bar{m}_i}{\sum \Delta t_i} = \frac{\sum \Delta t_i \bar{m}_i}{t} \]
					</p>

					<p>
						Thus, in contrast to \( w \) in the discrete model, in the
						continuous model the appropriate average is the arithmetic mean of
						the \( m \)'s. This is reasonable, since if \( m = \log w \), then
						the arithmetic mean of \( m \) is the log of the geometric mean of
						\( w \). If fitness is heritable, then the average value of \( m \)
						will change from generation to generation as the fitter types make a
						disproportionate contribution to future generations. This is another
						way of stating that natural selection will generally lead to an
						increase in the average fitness. Intuitively, the amount by which
						the average fitness changes per unit time should relate to the
						variability in fitness among types. We'll show now that the rate of
						increase is given by the variance in fitness. Assume there are \( k
						\) types with frequencies \( n_1, n_2, \dots, n_k \) and fitnesses
						\( m_1, m_2, \dots, m_k \) (Malthusian parameters), perfectly
						heritable, with no interbreeding. The same formulation applies to
						asexual clones or haploid loci. We wish to compute how \( \bar{m} \)
						changes over time:
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ \frac{d\bar{m}}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}\left( \frac{\sum m_i n_i}{N}
						\right) \] Applying the quotient rule: \[ d\bar{m} = \frac{N \sum
						m_i \frac{dn_i}{dt} - (\sum m_i n_i) \frac{dN}{dt}}{N^2} \] Using
						the known identities: \[ \frac{dn_i}{dt} = m_i n_i, \quad
						\frac{dN}{dt} = \bar{m} N \] Substituting in: \[ \frac{d\bar{m}}{dt}
						= \frac{\sum n_i m_i^2 - N \bar{m}^2}{N} = V_m \]
					</p>

					<p>
						Where \( V_m \) is the variance of the Malthusian fitness values \(
						m_i \). Therefore, the rate of change of average fitness is equal to
						the variance in fitness at that time. In Mendelian populations with
						genetic mixing, the rate of change is determined by the heritable
						part of the variance — that is, the part associated with
						transmissible gene differences. <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The
						rate of change of mean fitness is equal to the variance in fitness.

					<p>
						The total population grows exponentially but accelerated by
						increasing mean fitness. The mean fitness increases over time due to
						selection driven by heritable differences. Variance in fitness
						initially provides the 'fuel' for selection. Over the time, it
						typically declines as the fittest types dominate.

					<h2>Model 3: Overlapping Generations, Discrete Time Intervals</h2>

					<p>
						We now consider a more complicated model. Time is divided into
						discrete units, which are usually short relative to the life span.
						The model is especially appropriate for species such as many birds
						and mammals, which have specific breeding seasons but may survive
						through several such seasons. It is also a good approximation for
						organisms such as humans, where the population, although changing
						continuously, is censused at discrete intervals.
					</p>

					<p>
						Let \( n_{xt} \) be the number of individuals of age \( x \) at time
						\( t \). More precisely, "age \( x \)" means "in the age interval \(
						x \) to \( x+1 \)", as in ordinary discourse. In bisexual forms, it
						is convenient to adopt a convention regarding the sexes — for
						example, to count only females. Likewise, let \( b_x \) be the
						average number of progeny produced by an individual of age \( x \),
						counting only those progeny that survive long enough to be counted
						in the next time interval. We assume time is measured in years.
					</p>

					<p>
						For simplicity, we assume that no individual lives more than 5
						years, although the method can be extended to any number of
						intervals. Starting from \( t = 0 \), the number of individuals of
						age 0 at time 1 will be the number born to parents of age 0: \(
						n_{00} b_0 \), plus those from age 1: \( n_{10} b_1 \), and so on.
						Meanwhile, the number of individuals of age 1 at time 1 will be
						those who were age 0 at time 0 and survived to age 1: \( n_{00} p_0
						\), and so on.
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ \begin{align} n_{01} &= n_{00} b_0 + n_{10} b_1 + n_{20} b_2 +
						n_{30} b_3 + n_{40} b_4 \\ n_{11} &= n_{00} p_0 \\ n_{21} &= n_{10}
						p_1 \\ n_{31} &= n_{20} p_2 \\ n_{41} &= n_{30} p_3 \\ n_{51} &= 0
						\end{align} \]
					</p>

					<p>
						From these equations, the composition of the population a year later
						can be worked out:
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ \begin{align} n_{02} &= n_{01} b_0 + n_{11} b_1 + n_{21} b_2 +
						n_{31} b_3 + n_{41} b_4 \\ n_{12} &= n_{01} p_0 \\ n_{22} &= n_{11}
						p_1 \\ n_{32} &= n_{21} p_2 \\ n_{42} &= n_{31} p_3 \end{align} \]
					</p>

					<p>And so on for later years.</p>

					<p>
						The following table gives data on the composition of a population in
						successive years, starting with the artificial situation of 10,000
						individuals of age 0. The survival probabilities are:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>\( p_0 = 0.8 \)</li>
						<li>\( p_1 = 0.9 \)</li>
						<li>\( p_2 = 0.9 \)</li>
						<li>\( p_3 = 0.7 \)</li>
						<li>\( p_4 = 0 \)</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The birth rates are:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>\( b_0 = 0 \)</li>
						<li>\( b_1 = 0.3 \)</li>
						<li>\( b_2 = 0.5 \)</li>
						<li>\( b_3 = 0.5 \)</li>
						<li>\( b_4 = 0.2 \)</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Note that the population age distribution fluctuates for several
						generations and then reaches a stable proportion for each age class.
						At this point, the population is increasing at a constant rate of
						0.45% per year. This example illustrates the general principle that
						any population with a fixed schedule of age-specific birth and death
						rates eventually reaches a stable age distribution. Once this stage
						is reached, the growth rate becomes constant, and the equations for
						both discrete and continuous growth discussed earlier become
						applicable. The population growth ratio \( \frac{N_t}{N_{t-1}} \)
						converges to 1.0045 (that is, 0.45% growth per year), as expected.

					<h2>Model 4: Overlapping Generations, Continuous Change</h2>
					<p>
						The methods of the previous section are specifically adapted to
						organisms such as annually reproducing plants, where reproduction is
						seasonal but individuals may live through several seasons. In many
						other organisms, ranging from short-lived insects to humans, births
						and deaths occur continuously. When the population is large,
						individual events blend into a continuous process of population
						change. Mathematically, this is viewed as the limit of the previous
						discrete models as age intervals become infinitesimally small. The
						foundational equations were developed by Lotka and Fisher, and we
						follow Fisher's approach using time in years. Let \( l(x) \) be the
						probability of survival from birth to age \( x \), and let \( b(x)dx
						\) be the probability of reproducing in the age interval \( x \) to
						\( x + dx \). Then the probability of surviving to age \( x \) and
						reproducing in \( dx \) is \( l(x)b(x)dx \). The expected number of
						offspring during a lifetime is:
					</p>

					<p>\[ \int_0^A l(x)b(x) \, dx \]</p>

					<p>
						If we replace \( A \) with \( \infty \) (since \( b(x) = 0 \) for \(
						x > A \)), the integral remains valid. If the result is greater than
						1, the population grows; if less than 1, it declines. As shown
						earlier, a population with fixed age-specific rates will approach a
						stable age distribution, with constant growth rate. In the
						continuous case, we represent this growth as \( e^m \), where \( m
						\) is the Malthusian parameter. Individuals of age \( x \) at time
						\( t \) were born \( x \) years ago at time \( t - x \). Let \(
						B(t)dt \) be the number of births at time \( t \). Then the birth
						rate at time \( t - x \) was \( B(t - x) \). A fraction \( l(x) \)
						of those born then survive to age \( x \), and of those, a fraction
						\( b(x)dx \) will give birth now. Thus, the current birth rate at
						time \( t \) is:
					</p>

					<p>\[ \int_0^\infty B(t - x) l(x) b(x) \, dx \]</p>

					<p>
						If the population has reached age-distribution stability and is
						growing at rate \( m \), then the birth rate \( x \) years ago was:
					</p>

					<p>\[ B(t - x) = B(t) e^{-mx} \]</p>

					<p>Substituting into the previous expression:</p>

					<p>\[ 1 = \int_0^\infty e^{-mx} l(x) b(x) \, dx \]</p>

					<p>
						This equation can be solved for \( m \), given known \( l(x) \) and
						\( b(x) \). In practice, these are often based on discrete age
						classes. Once age-distribution stability is achieved, the same
						growth expressions apply as before:
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ \frac{dN}{dt} = mN \quad \text{and} \quad N_t = N_0 e^{mt} \]

					<h2>Fisher's Measure of Reproductive Value</h2>

					<p>
						Fisher also asked a genetically relevant question: To what extent
						does an individual of age \( x \) contribute to the ancestry of
						future generations? In order to answer this, he defines the quantity
						\( v(x) \), the reproductive value at age \( x \). Obviously, the
						reproductive value is 0 for an individual who is past the
						reproductive age. It is clearly lower at birth than a few years
						later, since a person of age 10, say, has a better chance of
						surviving to reproduce than a child at birth. Furthermore,
						reproduction would begin sooner and, in a growing population, this
						would increase the total contribution to future years by an earlier
						start. The value might be expected to be maximum somewhere near the
						beginning of the reproductive period. To define the reproductive
						value, we note first that the number of births from parents of age
						\( x \) is proportional to \( e^{-mx} l(x) b(x) dx \), as shown in
						the previous section. If we now think of this cohort of persons
						followed through the rest of their lifetimes, their total
						contribution is proportional to:
					</p>

					<p>\[ \large \int_x^\infty e^{-my} l(y) b(y) \, dy \]</p>

					<p>
						The exponential term serves to diminish the value of children born a
						long time in the future. This is analogous to the situation where
						the present value of a loan or investment is greater if it is to be
						paid soon rather than later. This is reversed, of course, if \( m \)
						is negative. The reproductive value is proportional to the total
						contribution per individual of this age, so we divide the
						contribution by the number of persons of that age. This leads to the
						definition of reproductive value at age \( x \), which is the
						<strong>expected future contribution</strong> of an individual of
						age \( x \) to all <strong>future generations</strong>, discounted
						by the population growth rate \( m \), given by:
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ v(x) = \frac{\int_x^\infty e^{-my} l(y) b(y) \, dy}{e^{-mx} l(x)}
						\]
					</p>

					<p>
						If \( x = 0 \), the denominator is equal to 1. Likewise, if \( x = 0
						\), the numerator is equal to 1. Therefore, the reproductive value
						at birth is 1, and \( v(x) \) is a measure of the reproductive value
						of an individual of age \( x \) relative to that of a newborn child.
						Earlier, we discussed the situation as if the population were in
						age-distribution equilibrium. On the other hand, we can accept the
						definition as given and apply it to populations in general. We can
						then accept that irrespective of the age distribution, the total
						reproductive value of a population increases at a rate given by \( m
						\).
					</p>
					<p>
						\[ e^{-mx} l(x) \cdot v(x) = \int_x^\infty e^{-my} l(y) b(y) \, dy
						\]
					</p>

					<p>Differentiating both sides:</p>

					<p>
						\[ e^{-mx} l(x) \left[ v(x) \frac{d l(x)}{dx} + l(x) \frac{d
						v(x)}{dx} - v(x) l(x) m \right] = -e^{-mx} l(x) b(x) \]
					</p>

					<p>
						We can cancel \( e^{-mx} \) on both sides and divide by \( v(x) l(x)
						\):
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ \frac{1}{l(x)} \frac{d l(x)}{dx} + \frac{1}{v(x)} \frac{d
						v(x)}{dx} - m = -\frac{b(x)}{v(x)} \]
					</p>

					<p>
						The leftmost term, with sign change, is simply the death rate \(
						d(x) \), for it is the rate of decrease in the number of individuals
						of age \( x \), expressed as a fraction of those alive at that age.
						Making this substitution and rearranging, we obtain:
					</p>

					<p>\[ \frac{d v(x)}{dx} - v(x) d(x) + b(x) = m v(x) \]</p>

					<p>
						The first term is the rate of
						<strong>change in reproductive value</strong> as an individual ages.
						The second is the rate of decrease due to mortality (**mortality
						rate**). The third is the rate of increase from new births (**birth
						rate**), which is simply the instantaneous birth rate since the
						value of each newborn, \( v(0) \), is 1. The left side thus gives
						the net change in reproductive value from aging, death, or
						reproduction. The \( n(x) \) individuals of age \( x \) contribute
						\( m n(x) v(x) \) to the increase in total reproductive value. Thus,
						the rate of change in reproductive value across all ages is given by
						\( m \). Adding up all ages, we have:
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = m V(t) \quad \Rightarrow \quad V_t = V_0 \cdot
						e^{mt} \]
					</p>

					<p>where:</p>

					<p>\[ V(t) = \int_0^\infty n(x, t) v(x) \, dx \]</p>

					<p>
						This is the total reproductive value of the population.
						<strong>This demonstrates Fisher's principle:</strong> The rate of
						increase in total reproductive value is equal to the Malthusian
						parameter times the total reproductive value, regardless of the age
						distribution. This means the equations become applicable to
						populations not in age equilibrium if each individual is weighted by
						the reproductive value appropriate to their age.

				<section id="PopRegulation">
					<h2>Regulation of Population Number</h2>

					<p>
						We have said nothing so far about population regulation. It is
						obvious that a population cannot grow exponentially forever. It must
						eventually reach a state where \( m \) becomes 0 or negative, or
						where in a discrete model \( w \) becomes 1 or less. The growth rate
						is eventually limited by all the factors that collectively make up
						the carrying capacity of the environment. In population genetics we
						are mainly concerned with the changes in proportions of different
						types of individuals, rather than total numbers. We shall consider
						some examples of this under various types of population regulation.
						However, we shall ignore until later in the book the complications
						introduced by Mendelian inheritance. We shall be dealing in this
						section with continuous models of the type introduced before.
						Alternatively, in principle we could deal with reproductive values
						rather than actual numbers by weighting each individual by the
						reproductive value appropriate to its age. By modifying previous
						growth equations, we have:
					</p>

					<p>\[ \frac{dN}{dt} = rN \left[ 1 - f(N) \right] \]</p>

					<p>
						The quantity \( r \) is the intrinsic rate of increase — the rate at
						which the population would grow if it had unlimited food supply and
						room for expansion. The function \( f(N) \) implies some change in
						the rate of increase with the size of the population. The regulation
						may be, for example, by limitation of food supply, by the space
						available, by the accumulation of toxic products, or by territorial
						behavior patterns. A particularly simple mode is provided by letting
						\( f(N) \) be a linear function of \( N \), say \( N/K \), where \(
						K \) is a constant sometimes called the carrying capacity of the
						environment. Such a population will grow approximately exponentially
						as long as \( N \ll K \), but as \( N \) approaches \( K \) the rate
						will decrease until size stability is reached at \( N = K \). If we
						replace \( N/K \) for \( f(N) \), then
					</p>

					<p>\[ \frac{dN}{dt} = \frac{rN(K - N)}{K} \]</p>

					<p>
						When \( N \ll K \), the growth is almost exponential, but as \( N
						\to K \), growth slows and \( dN/dt \to 0 \). The equation can also
						be rewritten as:
					</p>

					<p>\[ \frac{dN}{dt} + \frac{dN}{K - N} = rdt \]</p>

					<p>When integrated, gives:</p>

					<p>
						\[ t = \frac{1}{r} \cdot \ln \frac{N_t(K - N_0)}{(K - N_t)N_0} \]
					</p>

					<p>
						For example, if the intrinsic rate of increase of a population is 1%
						per year \( (r = 0.01) \) and the carrying capacity \( K \) is 5000,
						the time \( t \) required to change the number from \( N_0 = 1000 \)
						to \( N_t = 2000 \) is:
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ t = \frac{1}{0.01} \cdot \ln \left( \frac{2000 \cdot 4000}{3000
						\cdot 1000} \right) = 98 \text{ years.} \]
					</p>

					<p>
						If there were no regulations, the time required would simply be:
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ t = \frac{1}{0.01} \cdot \ln \left( \frac{N_t}{N_0} \right) = 69
						\text{ years.} \]
					</p>

					<p>
						Note that, whether there is regulation or not, the time required for
						a certain change is proportional to \( 1/r \). We can also write the
						equation in the inverse form, giving the number at time \( t \) as a
						function of \( t \) and the initial number \( N_0 \):
					</p>

					<p>\[ N_t = \frac{K}{1 + C_0 e^{-rt}} \]</p>

					<p>Where</p>

					<p>\[ C_0 = \frac{K - N_0}{N_0} \]</p>

					<p>
						This function can be graphically visualized and is called the
						"logistic" curve of population increase and has been widely used in
						ecology. Of course it is merely the simplest of a number of
						equations that could be derived and many populations, natural and
						experimental, depart widely from the model. As stated earlier, we
						are mainly concerned in population genetics with the proportion of
						different genes and genotypes rather than the total number. We shall
						see that many of the equations for the proportions of different
						types are the same, despite quite different mechanisms for
						regulation of the population number. The intrinsic rate of increase
						\( r \) is closely related to the Malthusian parameter \( m \). \( m
						\) can also be seen as the realized growth rate. We shall use the
						latter for the actual rate of change in numbers of the population,
						or of a part of the population, and \( r \) for the value this would
						take in a situation where the growth rate is not regulated.

				<section id="UnregulatedGrowth">
					<h2>Unregulated Growth</h2>

					<p>
						Consider two strains, 1 and 2, with numbers \( n_1 \) and \( n_2 \)
						and intrinsic growth rates \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \). These are the
						same as the Malthusian parameters when there is no restriction on
						continuous exponential growth. Let \( N \) be the total population
						number; \( N = n_1 + n_2 \). We shall designate by \( p_1 =
						\frac{n_1}{N} \) and \( p_2 = \frac{n_2}{N} \) the proportions of
						the two strains. If there is no regulation of the growth of either
						strain, the rates of increase are:
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ \frac{dn_1}{dt}= r_1 n_1 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{dn_2}{dt}=
						r_2 n_2 \]
					</p>

					<p>The rate of increase of the total population is:</p>

					<p>\[ \frac{dN}{dt}= r_1 n_1 + r_2 n_2 = \bar{r} N \]</p>

					<p>
						where \( \bar{r} \) is the mean of the \( r \)'s, weighted by the
						numbers in each population. To obtain the rate of change in the
						proportion of the two types, we write:
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ \begin{aligned} \frac{d \ln(p_1/p_2)}{dt} &= \frac{d
						\ln(n_1/n_2)}{dt} \\ &= \frac{d \ln(n_1)}{dt} - \frac{d
						\ln(n_2)}{dt} \\ &= \frac{1}{n_1} \frac{dn_1}{dt} - \frac{1}{n_2}
						\frac{dn_2}{dt} \\ &= r_1 - r_2 \end{aligned} \]
					</p>

					<p>and also:</p>

					<p>
						\[ \begin{aligned} \frac{d \ln(p_1/p_2)}{dt} &= \frac{d
						\ln(p_1)}{dt} - \frac{d \ln(1 - p_1)}{dt} \\ &= \frac{1}{p_1(1 -
						p_1)} \frac{dp_1}{dt} \end{aligned} \]
					</p>

					<p>Combining the two equations:</p>

					<p>\[ \frac{dp_1}{dt} = (r_1 - r_2) \cdot p_1(1 - p_1) \]</p>

					<p>
						Notice that if we let \( p_1 = \frac{N}{K} \) and \( r_1 - r_2 = r
						\), we obtain the logistic equation discussed earlier. Despite the
						fact that both strains are growing exponentially, the proportion of
						one type (the faster-growing one) is increasing according to the
						logistic equation. We can simplify a bit further by considering \(
						\bar{r} = p_1 r_1 + p_2 r_2 \).
					</p>

					<p>\[ \frac{dp_1}{dt} = p_1 (r_1 - \bar{r}) \]</p>

					<p>
						This form of the equation suggests the extension to more than two
						strains. When three or more strains are present, the same equation
						is correct for the rate of change of a particular strain, and \(
						\bar{r} \) is the weighted average of the rates of increase of all
						the strains. In this model, the total population is increasing
						exponentially at any instant, although the rate of increase \(
						\bar{r} \) is changing continuously — unrealistic for any long
						period of time. We only discuss it here to make the point that the
						model can accurately describe the rate of change of the proportion
						of one type in a mixed population even when the numbers are changing
						according to quite a different rule.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="LogisticRegulation">
					<h2>Logistic Regulation of Total Number</h2>
					<h2>Logistic Regulation of Total Number</h2>

					<p>A simple model for this situation is given by the equations:</p>

					<p>
						\[ \frac{dn_1}{dt} = n_1 \left(r_1 - \frac{\bar{r}N}{K} \right)
						\quad \text{and} \quad \frac{dn_2}{dt} = n_2 \left(r_2 -
						\frac{\bar{r}N}{K} \right) \]
					</p>

					<p>
						The total population increases logistically until it reaches an
						equilibrium at \( N = K \), as can be seen by the following:
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ \frac{dN}{dt} = \frac{d(n_1 + n_2)}{dt} = r_1 n_1 + r_2 n_2 -
						(n_1 + n_2) \cdot \frac{\bar{r}N}{K} \]
					</p>

					<p>
						But, since \( N = n_1 + n_2 \) and \( N\bar{r} = r_1 n_1 + r_2 n_2
						\), then:
					</p>

					<p>\[ \frac{dN}{dt} = \bar{r} N \left(1 - \frac{N}{K} \right) \]</p>

					<p>
						At the same time that \( N \) is changing according to this rule, we
						can see what is happening to the proportions of the two types by
						writing:
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ \frac{d \ln(p_1/p_2)}{dt} = \frac{1}{n_1} \frac{dn_1}{dt} -
						\frac{1}{n_2} \frac{dn_2}{dt} = r_1 - r_2 \]
					</p>

					<p>Or, viewing it a different way:</p>

					<p>\[ \frac{dp_1}{dt} = p_1 \cdot (r_1 - \bar{r}) \]</p>

					<p>
						Again, the proportion of strain 1 is changing logistically. Written
						in its integrated form, we have:
					</p>

					<p>\[ \ln \left( \frac{p}{1 - p} \right) = C + rt \]</p>

					<p>
						Where \( r = r_1 - r_2 \) and \( C = \ln \left( \frac{p_0}{1 - p_0}
						\right) \), a constant determined by the initial composition. This
						form is also known as the <strong>log-ratio dynamics</strong> or
						<strong>replicator equation form</strong>. This suggests a
						convenient way of plotting data from selection experiments. By
						plotting \( \ln \left( \frac{p}{1 - p} \right) \) against time, one
						can easily see whether the trend is linear and thus whether the
						logistic equation is appropriate. Alternatively, if we wish to know
						how much time is needed to change the proportion from \( p_0 \) to
						\( p_t \), we can write the following:
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ t = \frac{1}{r} \cdot \ln \left( \frac{p_t(1 - p_0)}{(1 -
						p_t)p_0} \right) \]
					</p>

					<p>
						Which gives the time as a function of the frequency of the type of
						interest. Note that the time required to accomplish a certain change
						in proportion is strictly proportional to the reciprocal of \( r \).

						The previous example assumed that the total population has an

						type replaces the other, the total population increases. A simple

					</p>

					<p>
						It is clear now that population is controlled by a

						\( \bar{r} \). The total number changes according to:
					</p>

					<p>\[ \frac{dN}{dt} = N( \bar{r} - cN) \]</p>

					<p>
						The population reaches a limit when \( N = \bar{r}/c \); for this

					</p>

					<p>\[ \frac{dp_1}{dt} = p_1(r_1 - \bar{r}) \]</p>

					<p>
						This situation is probably quite unusual in nature. The size of the

					<h2>Regulation by Efficiency of Space or Food Utilization</h2>

					<p>
						If populations are regulated by the available space, food, or some
						other limiting factor, the type that wins in the competition may not
						be the one with the higher intrinsic rate of increase, but rather
						the one that can maintain the largest numbers in this environment.
						The two strains share space and resources where total population
						size is limited not by a hard ceiling, but by how each strain can
						utilize the environment. A simple model illustrating this
						possibility is given by:
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ \frac{dn_1}{dt} = r_1 n_1 \frac{K_1 - N}{K_1} \quad \text{and}
						\quad \frac{dn_2}{dt} = r_2 n_2 \frac{K_2 - N}{K_2} \]
					</p>

					<p>
						One interpretation of \( K_1 \) is that this is the maximum
						population size that strain 1 can maintain when it is the only
						species; \( K_2 \) has the same meaning for strain 2. Suppose that
						\( r_1 = r_2 \), but \( K_1 \neq K_2 \).
					</p>

					<p>The change in total number is given by:</p>

					<p>
						\[ \frac{dN}{dt} = rN \left[ 1 - \frac{n_1}{K_1} - \frac{n_2}{K_2}
						\right] \]
					</p>

					<p>
						where \( r = r_1 = r_2 \). The change in the proportion of type 1
						is:
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ \frac{dp_1}{dt} = R \cdot p_1 p_2 = R p_1 (1 - p_1) \] where \[ R
						= Nr \left( \frac{K_1 - K_2}{K_1 K_2} \right) \]
					</p>

					<p>
						The presented equation is a general form of the logistic equation,
						but it is not the same since \( R \) is not a constant. Still, it
						can be considered of logistic form, showing frequency-dependent
						selection. However, in many cases \( R \) changes slowly, and such
						an equation accurately describes the rate of change at any
						particular time. In an uncrowded environment, the success of a
						population is determined mainly by its intrinsic rate of increase,
						\( r \). In a crowded environment, the carrying capacity \( K \) for
						the species may be more important. MacArthur and Wilson (1967) refer
						to <em>r-selection</em> and <em>K-selection</em>. In an uncrowded
						environment (<em>r-selection</em>), types that harvest the most food
						— even if they are wasteful — have the largest rate of increase. On
						the other hand, in a crowded environment (<em>K-selection</em>),
						there is great value on efficiency of utilization rather than simple
						productivity. These equations are widely applicable, even when
						populations may differ greatly in their states. The total population
						may be growing, static, or decreasing, and the different genotypes
						may differ in intrinsic birth rates, death rates, or their responses
						to the environment — yet the equations for changes in proportions
						may be basically similar. For these reasons, population genetics has
						usually ignored the total numbers and concentrated on the
						proportions.
