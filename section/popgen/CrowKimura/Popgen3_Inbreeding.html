					<h2>3. DecreaseHet</h2>
					<p>
						Inbreeding occurs when mates are more closely related than they
						would be if they had been chosen at random from the population.
						Related individuals have one or more ancestors in common, so the
						extent of inbreeding is related to the amount of ancestry that is
						shared by the parents of the inbred individuals. Alternatively
						stated, the degree of inbreeding of an individual is determined by
						the proportion of genes that his parents have in common. An
						immediate consequence of this sharing of parental genes is that the
						inbred individual will frequently inherit the same gene from each
						parent <strong>(identical by descent)</strong>. Thus inbreeding
						increases the amount of homozygosity. So one observable effect of
						inbreeding is that recessive genes, previously hidden by
						heterozygosity with dominant alleles, will be expressed. Since most
						such genes are harmful in one way or another, inbreeding usually
						leads to a decrease in size, fertility, vigor, yield, and fitness
						<strong>(inbreeding depression)</strong>. There are also likely to
						be loci segregating in a population where a heterozygote is fitter
						than either of the two corresponding homozygotes. In this case, too,
						inbreeding leads to decreased fitness. Another consequence of
						consanguineous mating within the population is greater genetic
						variability, since genes tend to be concentrated in the same
						individuals. Usually, because of the correlation between genotype
						and phenotype, this leads to an increase in phenotypic variability.
						Inbreeding may follow either of two patterns. There may be a certain
						amount of consanguineous mating within a population, with the
						consequences just mentioned. On the other hand, the inbreeding may
						be such as to break the population into subgroups. An extreme
						example is continued self-fertilization in which the population (if
						it is constant size and each parent contributes equally to the next
						generation) is divided into a set of subpopulations of one
						individual each. Likewise, a pattern of repeated sib mating could
						lead to a series of isolated populations of size 2. As a third
						example, there may be a natural population which is divided into
						isolated subpopulations, within each of which mating is random or
						nearly so. The effect will be that each subpopulation becomes more
						homozygous, and therefore the whole population does. The individual
						subpopulations become more uniform genetically; but, since they
						become homozygous for different genes, the population as a whole
						becomes more variable. Of course, there may be only partial
						isolation, with intermediate consequences. A point that at first
						seems paradoxical is that within a subpopulation there is an
						increase in homozygosity despite the fact that mating within this
						group is random. The reason is that there are random changes in the
						frequencies of the individual alleles and these, on average, lead to
						a decrease in heterozygosity. As an extreme example,
						self-fertilization can be regarded as random mating (i.e., random
						combination of gametes) within a population of one. The gene
						frequencies at different, previously heterozygous loci change from
						\(\frac{1}{2}\) to 0 or 1. Whether inbreeding leads to subdivision
						or not, it can be measured in the same way - by Wright's (1922)
						coefficient of inbreeding, \(f\), which measures the proportion by
						which the heterozygosity has been decreased or the probability of
						two alleles at a locus to be identical by descent. As we shall show
						later, other population properties can also be related to \(f\).
						However, before discussing \(f\), we shall illustrate with two
						simple examples the effect of continued inbreeding.
					</p>

					<h2>3.1 Decrease in Heterozygosity with Inbreeding</h2>

					<p>
						The qualitative effect of continued inbreeding can be seen by
						examining the most extreme form, self-fertilization. In a
						self-fertilization population, the progeny of homozygotes are like
						their parents, whereas the progeny of heterozygotes are
						\(\frac{1}{2}\) heterozygotes and \(\frac{1}{4}\) each of the two
						homozygous types. Thus, in each generation the proportion of the
						heterozygous loci is reduced by half and the homozygous types are
						correspondingly increased.
					</p>

					\[ H_t = \frac{H_0}{2^t} \]

					<p>And the homozygosity increases as:</p>

					\[ \begin{align} \text{Proportion AA} &= D + \frac{H}{2} \\
					\text{Proportion aa} &= R + \frac{H}{2} \end{align} \]

					<p>
						The key point here is that while the genotype frequencies change,
						allele frequencies remain constant. Inbreeding restructures the gene
						pool, but does not shift it. This is illustrated:
					</p>

					\[ \begin{array}{c c c c} \hline \text{Generation} & AA & Aa & aa \\
					\hline 0 & D & H & R \\ 1 & D+\frac{H}{4} & \frac{H}{2} &
					R+\frac{H}{4} \\ 2 & D+\frac{3H}{8} & \frac{H}{4} & R+\frac{3H}{8} \\
					3 & D+\frac{7H}{16} & \frac{H}{8} & R+\frac{7H}{16} \\ 4 &
					D+\frac{15H}{32} & \frac{H}{16} & R+\frac{15H}{32} \\ \text{Limit} &
					D+\frac{H}{2} & 0 & R+\frac{H}{2} \\ \hline \end{array} \]

					<p>
						If \(H_0\) is the initial proportion of heterozygotes, the
						proportion after \(t\) generations of self-fertilization is
						\(\frac{H_0}{2^t}\). If the original population were panmictic, with
						\(AA, Aa\) and \(aa\) genotypes in the proportions \(p^2, 2pq\) and
						\(q^2\) \((p + q = 1)\), the individual line eventually becomes
						homozygous. The probability of being \(AA\) is \(D + \frac{H}{2} =
						p^2 + pq = p(p+q) = p\); likewise, the probability of being \(aa\)
						is \(q\). Thus, the population becomes broken into separate lines,
						each homozygous for one of the other of the genes in the ratio of
						their original frequencies in the population. Notice one other fact:
						There has been no change in the gene frequency. Inbreeding per se
						does not change the proportions of the various genes, only the way
						they are combined into homozygous and heterozygous genotypes. With
						less extreme forms of inbreeding, the results are similar, though
						the change in heterozygosity is less rapid. The results for
						continued brother-sister mating are shown below. Again there is a
						decrease in the proportion of heterozygotes, with the amount
						deducted being divided equally and added to the two homozygous
						types. These results may be obtained by writing out all the possible
						mating generation after generation, as was done by the early
						investigators (Fish 1914 and Jennings 1916). This and several other
						systems of recurrent inbreeding were worked out by these authors.
						The papers are now mainly of historical interest since more general
						methods are available.
					</p>

					\[ \begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c} \hline \text{Generation} & \text{Relative
					Heterozygosity} & \text{Decrease in Heterozygosity} & \text{Rates of
					Change In Heterozygosity} & \\ t & \frac{H_t}{H_0}=P &
					\frac{H_0-H_t}{H_0}=f & \frac{H_t}{H_{t-1}} &
					\frac{H_{t-1}-H_t}{H_{t-1}} \\ \hline 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 &
					\frac{2}{2} & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 2 & \frac{3}{4} & \frac{1}{4} &
					\frac{3}{4}=0.750 & 0.250 \\ 3 & \frac{5}{8} & \frac{3}{8} &
					\frac{5}{6}=0.833 & 0.167 \\ 4 & \frac{8}{16} & \frac{8}{16} &
					\frac{8}{10}=0.800 & 0.200 \\ 5 & \frac{13}{32} & \frac{19}{32} &
					\frac{13}{16}=0.812 & 0.188 \\ 6 & \frac{21}{64} & \frac{43}{64} &
					\frac{21}{26}=0.808 & 0.192 \\ \text{Limit} & 0 & 1 & \lambda=0.809 &
					0.191 \\ \hline \end{array} \]

					<p>
						In this example, the heterozygosity follows a simple rule. The
						numerator in successive generations is given by the Fibonacci series
						in which each term is the sum of the two preceding terms, while the
						denominator doubles each generation. The reduction in
						heterozygosity, expressed as a fraction of the initial
						heterozygosity, is the same regardless of the initial gene
						frequencies and, as shall show later, the number of alleles. The
						relative heterozygosity, \(\frac{H_t}{H_0}\) has been called by
						Wright (1951) the <em>panmictic index</em> for which he used the
						letter \(P\). \(1 - P\) is the inbreeding coefficient, for which
						Wright has used the letter \(F\). We shall use the lower case \(f\)
						in order to reserve \(F\) for multiple-locus inbreeding effects. The
						last two columns give the rate of change in heterozygosity. Notice
						that the ratio \(\frac{H_t}{H_{t-1}}\) after a few oscillations
						rapidly approaches a constant value. The limiting value of the ratio
						of heterozygosity to that in the previous generation is usually
						designated by \(\lambda\). In summary, the conceptual synthesis can
						be seen as follows:

					<h2>3.2 Wright's Inbreeding Coefficient, \(f\)</h2>

					<p>
						Wright's (1922) original derivation of the inbreeding coefficient,
						\(f\), was through correlation analysis. An alternative approach
						using only probability rules has been developed by Haldane and
						Moshinsky (1939), Cotterman (1940), and Malécot (1948). They
						distinguish between two ways in which an individual can be
						homozygous for a given locus. The two homologous genes may be:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Alike in state, that is to say, indistinguishable by any effect
							they produce (or perhaps, when molecular genetics has become
							sufficiently precise, alike in their nucleotide sequence).
						</li>
						<li>
							Identical by descent, in that both are derived from the same gene
							in a common ancestor.
						</li>
					</ol>

					<p>
						We follow the notation of Cotterman in designating an individual
						whose two homologous genes are identical by descent as
						<em>autozygous</em>. If the two alleles are of independent origin
						(as far as known from our pedigree information), the individual is
						<em>allozygous</em>. The effect of inbreeding is to increase that
						part of the homozygous without being autozygous, if the two
						homologous genes are alike in state but not identical by descent.
						Conversely, an autozygous individual can be heterozygous for this
						locus if one of the two alleles has mutated since their common
						origin, although this is negligibly rare if only a small number of
						generations is being considered. The inbreeding coefficient, \(f\),
						is defined as the probability that the individual is autozygous for
						the locus in question. Alternatively stated, it is the probability
						that a pair of alleles in the two gametes that unite to form the
						individual are identical by descent. An individual with inbreeding
						coefficient \(f\) has a probability \(f\) that the two genes at a
						particular locus are identical and a probability \(1-f\) that they
						are not identical, and therefore independent. If they are
						independent, the frequencies of the genotypes will be given by the
						binomial formula. If they are identical, the frequencies of the gene
						pairs will be simply the frequencies of the alleles in the
						population. Thus, for two alleles, \(A_1\) and \(A_2\), with
						frequencies \(p_1\) and \(p_2 \: (p_1 + p_2 = 1)\), the genotype
						frequencies are:
					</p>

					\[ \begin{array}{cc} \hline & \text{Allozygous} & \text{Autozygous} \\
					\hline \text{Homogygous, } A_1A_1: & p_1^2(1-f) & p_1 f \\
					\text{Homogygous, } A_1A_2: & 2p_1p_2(1-f) & \\ \text{Homogygous, }
					A_2A_2: & p_2^2(1-f) & p_2f \\ \text{Total} & 1-f & f \\ \hline
					\end{array} \]

					<p>
						Notice that when \(f = 0\) these formulas reduce to the usual
						Hardy-Weinberg proportion. When \(f=1\) the population is completely
						homozygous. Thus \(f\) ranges from 0 in a randomly mating population
						to 1 with complete homozygosity. How to compute \(f\) from a
						pedigree will be shown later. Multiple alleles introduce no
						difficulty. The genotype frequencies are a natural extension of the
						results for two alleles. The frequencies are:
					</p>

					\[ A_iA_i: p_i^2 (1-f) + p_i f \]

					<p>For homozygous genotypes, and:</p>

					\[ A_iA_j: 2p_ip_j (1-f) \]

					<p>
						For heterozygous genotypes. The expected proportion of heterozygous
						genotypes with inbreeding coefficient \(f\), \(H_f\), is given by:
					</p>

					\[ H_f = \sum_{i \ne j} p_i p_j (1-f) = H_0 (1-f) \]

					<p>Given that:</p>

					\[ f = \frac{H_0 - H_f}{H_0} \]

					<p>
						Where \(H_0\) is a constant equal to the proportion of heterozygotes
						expected with random mating \((f=0)\). The summation is over all
						combinations of values of \(i\) and \(j\) except when these are
						equal. This proves the assertion made earlier that the inbreeding
						coefficient measures the fraction by which the heterozygosity has
						been reduced. We have written the formula as if, when \(f=0\), the
						population is in Hardy-Weinberg proportions. However, for any
						measured \(f\) (as determined, for example, from a pedigree), the
						heterozygosity, \(H\), is \(H_0(1-f)\), where \(H_0\) is whatever
						the heterozygosity would have been in the absence of the observed
						inbreeding. To be concrete, the inbreeding coefficient for the child
						of a cousin marriage is \(\frac{1}{16}\) (as we shall show later);
						therefore the child of such a marriage is \(\frac{15}{16}\) as
						heterozygous as if his parents had the same relationship as a random
						pair in this population. There is a simple relationship between the
						correlation coefficient, \(r\), and the inbreeding coefficient,
						\(f\). If we assign numerical values to each allele, then the
						inbreeding coefficient, \(f\), is the correlation between these
						values in a pair of uniting gametes. In fact, Wright's original
						derivation of the inbreeding coefficient was through correlation
						methods. The relationship between \(r\) and \(f\) can be shown in
						the following way. For convenience, we assign the value 1 to \(A_1\)
						and 0 to allele \(A_2\), though we would get the same result with
						any values. The calculations are shown below. Since the sum of the
						genotype frequencies is equal to 1, the weighted sum and the mean of
						any are the same. For example, the sum (and mean) of egg value,
						\(X\), is \([p_2^2(1-f)+p_2f](0)+[p_1p_2(1-f)](1)+
						[p_1p_2(1-f)](0)+[p_1^2(1-f)+p_1f](1)\), which after some algebraic
						simplification reduces to \(p_1\). The other calculations are given
						in the table, using the standard formula for calculation of \(r\).
					</p>

					\] \[ \bar X = p_1 p_2(1 - f) + p_1^2 (1 - f) + p_1 f = p_1 \]

					<p>
						Likewise, \(\hat Y = \text{mean}(X^2) = \text{mean}(Y^2) = p_1\)
					</p>

					\[ \begin{align} r_{xy} &= \frac{\bar{XY}-\bar X \bar
					Y}{\sqrt{(\text{mean}(X^2)- \bar X^2)(\text{mean}(Y^2)- \bar Y^2)}} \\
					r_{xy} &= \frac{p_1^2(1-f)+p_1f-p_1^2}{p_1 - p_1^2} = f \end{align} \]

					<p>
						Demonstration without restriction as to number of alleles and
						letting the contribution of the alleles differ. Furthermore, if the
						genic values are summed over \(k\) loci the covariance will be:
					</p>

					\[ f \sum_k \sum_i p_{ik} a_{ik}^2 \]

					<p>
						Where \(p_{ik}\) and \(a_{ik}\) are the frequency and value of the
						\(i\)th allele at the \(k\)th locus. This is \(f\) times the
						variance. Hence \(f\) is the expected value of the correlation
						between the genetic values of two uniting gametes, regardless of the
						number of loci and number of alleles under consideration. The
						equivalence of \(r\) and \(f\) suggests an interpretation of the
						correlation coefficient. If a measurement can be thought of as being
						the sum of a number of elements, then the correlation coefficient is
						the measure of the fraction of these elements that are common to the
						two measurements, the other elements being chosen at random. This
						interpretation is useful in many branches of science. In
						quantitative genetics, the elements can obviously be interpreted as
						cumulative acting genes.
					</p>

					\[ V_x = \sum_i p_i a_i^2 \]

					<p>
						Since the variance of the egg value is the sum of the squares of the
						allele values, each weighted by its frequency. \(V_y\) is the same.
					</p>

					\[ COV_{XY} = (1-f) \left[ \sum_i p_i^2 a_i^2 + \sum_{i \ne j }p_i p_j
					a_i a_j\right] + f \sum_i p_i a_i^2 \]

					<p>
						But the quantity in brackets is equal to \(\left[\sum_i p_i a_i
						\right]^2\) which is equal to 0, because the sum of the deviations
						from the mean is 0. Therefore,
					</p>

					\[ COV_{XY} = f \sum_i p_i a_i^2 \]

					<p>
						The correlation coefficient, being the ratio of the covariance to
						the geometric mean of the two variances (which in this case are the
						same), is \(f\), as was to be shown:
					</p>

					\[ r_{XY} = \frac{COV_{XY}}{V_x} = f \]

						individuals, will be identical. The answer to this is clearly the
						same as the inbreeding coefficient of a progeny produced by these
						two individuals. Hence, the inbreeding coefficient of an individual
						is the same as the coefficient of consanguinity of its parents
						(Malécot, 1948).
					</p>

					<p>
						There is a bewildering plethora of alternative names for this
						coefficient. Malécot, who introduced the idea, called it the
						<em>coefficient de parenté</em>. Falconer (1960) calls it the
						<em>coancestry</em>. Kempthorne (1957) translated
						<em>parenté</em> into <em>parentage</em>. Malécot himself has, on at
						least one occasion, translated it into <em>kinship</em>.
					</p>

					<p>
						A different measure of relatedness, introduced much earlier and
						still widely used, is Wright's (1922)
						<em>coefficient of relationship</em>, \( r_{IJ} \), defined as:
					</p>

					<p>\[ r_{IJ} = \frac{2f_{IJ}}{\sqrt{(1+f_I)(1+f_J)}} \]</p>

					<p>
						For two individuals that are not inbred, the coefficient of
						relationship is exactly twice the coefficient of consanguinity.
					</p>

					<p>
						As we shall show later, the coefficient of relationship is the
						correlation between the genic, or genetic, values of the two
						individuals. If the genes act without dominance or epistasis, and
						there is no effect of the environment on the trait being measured,
						this is the expected correlation. We shall also show later the
						effect of dominance on the correlation between relatives.

					<h4>3.4 Computation of $f$ from pedigrees</h4>

					<p>
						The procedure for computing the inbreeding or consanguinity
						coefficient from a pedigree follows directly from the definition of
						$f$. In this pedigree individual $I$ is inbred because both his
						parents are descended from a single common ancestor, $A$. All
						unrelated ancestors, which are irrelevant to the inbreeding of $I$
						are omitted from the pedigree. We ask for the probability that $I$
						is autozygous; i.e., that homologous genes contributed to $I$ by
						gametes $b$ and $e$ are both descended from the same gene in
						ancestor $A$. We shall use the notation $Prob(c=b)$ to mean the
						probability that $c$ and $b$ carry identical genes for the locus
						under consideration. $Prob(b=c)=1/2$, since the gene in $b$ has an
						equal chance of having come from $C$ or from $B$'s other parent.
						Likewise, $Prob(c=a)=1/2$. The probability that $a$ and $a's$ carry
						identical genes may be obtained as follows: Let the two alleles in
						$A$ be called $W$ and $Z$. Then there are four equally likely
						possibilities for gametes $a$ and $a$'s: (1) $W$ and $W$, (2) $Z$
						and $Z$, (3) $W$ and $Z$, and (4) $Z$ and $W$. In the first two
						cases they are identical, so the probability is $1/2$ that $a$ and
						$a's$ get the same gene from $A$. However, there is an additional
						possibility if $A$ is inbreed, for in this case two alleles $W$ and
						$Z$ may both be descended from some more remote ancestor not shown
						in the figure. The probability that $A$ is autozygous, is, by
						definition, in inbreeding coefficient of $A$, $f_A$. If $A$ is
						inbreed
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ Prob(a=a')=\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}f_A=\frac{1}{2}(1+f_A) \]
					</p>

					<p>If $A$ is not inbreed</p>

					<p>\[ Prob(a=a')=\frac{1}{2} \]</p>

					<p>
						Continuing around the path $BCADE$, $Prob(a'=d)=Prob(d=e)=1/2$.
						Summarizing, $b$ and $e$ will carry identical genes only if $b, c,
						a, a', d, and e$ do so. Therefore, since all these probabilities are
						independent
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ f_I = f_{BE}=Prob(b=e)=\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot
						\frac{1}{2}(1+f_A) \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}=
						\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^5(1+f_A) \]
					</p>

					<p>
						For b=c, c=a, a=a', a'=d, d=e, respectively. If $A$ is not inbred
						(and according to information given in this pedigree she is not) the
						inbreeding coefficient of I is simple (1/2)^5. Notice that whether
						B,C,D, E is inbred is irrelevant, since, for example, the
						probability that $c$ and $b$ are identical is independent of the
						gene contributed by $B$'s other parent. The general rule is that the
						contribution of a path of relationship through a common ancestor is
						$(1/2)^n (1+f_a)$ where $n$ is the number of individuals in the path
						from one parent to the ancestor and back through the other parent.
						In more complicated pedigrees there may be multiple paths through an
						ancestor or more than one common ancestor. The contributions to the
						inbreeding coefficient of I from the various paths are as follows.
						The common ancestor in a path is underlined.
					</p>
					<p>
						\[ \begin{array}{|c|c|} \hline \text{Path} & \text{Contribution to
						f} \\ \hline ABD\underline{E}GH & \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 =
						\frac{1}{64} \\ ACD\underline{E}GH & \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 =
						\frac{1}{64} \\ ABD\underline{F}H & \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^5 =
						\frac{1}{32} \\ ACD\underline{F}H & \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^5 =
						\frac{1}{32} \\ \hline \end{array} \]
					</p>

					<p>
						As we are considering only a single locus, the paths are all
						mutually exclusive; if $I$ is autozygous for a pair of genes
						inherited through one path it cannot at the same time be autozygous
						for a pair inherited through another. Therefore the total
						probability for autozygosity is the sum of the probabilities for the
						separate paths, in this case $3/32$. This pedigree was not
						complicated by the common ancestor of any path being inbred.
						Individual $A$ is inbred, but this is irrelevant since $A$ is not a
						common ancestor. Only inbreeding of $E$ or $F$ would matter. This
						complication arises in the pedigree, where there are several inbred
						individuals in the pedigree and two of these, $B$ and $D$, are
						common ancestors of one or more paths. We begin by noting the
						inbreeding coefficients of $D$ and $B$. The inbreeding coefficient
						of $D$, $f_D$, is $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3(1+f_D)=\frac{9}{64}$.
						The components of $f_I$ through the various paths are:
					</p>
					<p>
						\[ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline \text{Path} & \text{Contribution to
						f} & \text{Value} \\ \hline AEF & \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 &
						0.1250 \\ ABF & \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3(1+f_B) & 0.1426 \\ ABEF &
						\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 & 0.0625 \\ AEBF &
						\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 & 0.0625 \\ ABCDEF &
						\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6(1+f_D) & 0.0176 \\ AEDCBF &
						\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6(1+f_D) & 0.0176 \\ \hline & f_I = f_{AF}
						& 0.4278 \\ \hline \end{array} \]
					</p>

					<p>
						Notice that the inbreeding of $B$ is taken into consideration in
						path $ABF$ where B is a common ancestor, but ignored in the other
						paths where $B$ is not the common ancestor. A path such as $ABCDEBF$
						is not included because $B$ enters twice; the contribution to this
						path is included in the path $ABF$ by the term $(1+f_B)$. To
						summarize: The inbreeding coefficient of an individual $I$, or the
						coefficient of consanguinity of his parents, $J$ and $K$, is the sum
						of a series of terms, one for each path leading from a parent to a
						common ancestor and back through the other parent. The general
						formula is
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ f_I = f_{JK} = \sum\left[\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n(1+f_A)\right]
						\]
					</p>

					<p>
						Where the summation is over all possible paths, $n$ is the number of
						individuals in the path (counting $J$ and $K$ but not $I$) and $f_A$
						is the inbreeding coefficient of the common ancestor at the apex of
						this path. A path cannot pass through the same individual twice. No
						reversal of direction is permitted except at the common ancestor;
						always go against the arrows when going from one parent to the
						ancestor, and with them when coming back through the other. It is
						helpful in avoiding counting the same path twice to adopt the
						convention of starting all paths with the same parent (the male,
						say) and ending with the other. In the earlier literature the
						procedure given for computing $f$ was to count the number of steps
						between individuals in a path rather than the number of individuals.
						The results are of course the same either way. We use it because it
						follows more naturally from our derivation than the earlier form,
						and because it is easily adapted to X-linked genes. An X-chromosome
						gene that is in a gamete produced by a male must be the same as was
						in the egg from which this male came. Therefore the probability of
						identity by descent in these two gametes is $1$, rather than $1/2$
						as it would be for a female or an autosomal locus. Hence each male
						in a path multiplies the probability of identity through this path
						by $1$ rather than $1/2$ as it would be for a female or an autosomal
						locus. Hence each male in a path multiplies the probability of
						identity through this path by $1$ rather than $1/2$, and the effect
						is as if the males were not counted at all. Furthermore, a male does
						not receive an X-chromosome from his father, so a path involving two
						successive males makes no contribution to the probability of
						identity of X-chromosomal loci. Therefore the rule for obtaining the
						inbreeding coefficient for a sex-linked locus in females is: Proceed
						as usual except that only females in a path are counted and any path
						with two successive males is omitted entirely.

					<h4>3.5 Phenotypic Effects of Consanguineous Matings</h4>

					<p>
						In the previous section, the frequency of the recessive gene causing
						phenylketonuric feeble-mindedness was given as approximately
						$1/100$. Therefore with random mating the frequency of persons
						homozygous for the gene is the square of this or $1/10000$. We now
						inquire how much this is enhanced with consanguineous marriage. The
						probability of an affected child is $p^2(1-f)+pf$ where $p$ is the
						frequency of the recessive allele and $f$ is the inbreeding
						coefficient of the child. If the parents are cousins, their
						coefficient of consanguinity of the inbreeding coefficient of their
						child is $1/16$. With $p=1/100$ and $f=1/16$, the expected frequency
						of homozygous recessives is $115/16000$ or approximately $7/10000$,
						a 7-fold increase compared with the risk when the parents are
						unrelated.
					</p>
					<p>
						\[ \begin{array}{c|cc|c} \hline & \text{Frequency of affected when}
						& & \\ \text{Gene Frequency} & f=0 & f=1/16 & \text{Ratio} \\ \hline
						0.1 & 0.01 & 0.016 & 1.6 \\ 0.01 & 0.0001 & 0.00072 & 7.2 \\ 0.005 &
						0.000025 & 0.000335 & 13.4 \\ 0.001 & 0.000001 & 0.000063 & 63 \\
						\hline \end{array} \]
					</p>

					<p>
						What proportion of the persons affected with recessive traits come
						from consanguineous marriages? This proportion, $k$, may be obtained
						by dividing the number of affected from consanguineous marriages by
						the total number of affected. If $c$ is the proportion of
						consanguineous marriages in the population of size $N$, the number
						of affected from consanguineous marriages is $Nc[p^2(1-f)+pf]$,
						where $f$ is the coefficient of consanguinity of the parents and $p$
						is the recessive gene frequency. The total number of affected in the
						population is $Nc[p^2(1-\bar{f})+p\bar{f}]$, where $\bar{f}$ is the
						mean inbreeding coefficient in the population. Therefore
					</p>

					<p>
						\[ K = \frac{c[p^2(1-f)+pf]}{c[p^2(1-\bar{f})+p\bar{f}]} =
						\frac{c[p+(1-p)f]}{p-p\bar{f}+\bar{f}} \]
					</p>

					<p>or, since $p\bar{f}$ is usually very small</p>

					<p>\[ K = \frac{c[p+(1-p)f]}{p+\bar{f}} \]</p>

					<p>approximately.</p>

					<p>
						The most common consanguineous marriage is between first cousins.
						For $f=1/16$
					</p>

					<p>\[ K = \frac{c(1+15p)}{16[p+\bar{f}(1-p)]} \]</p>

					<p>or approximately</p>

					<p>\[ \frac{c(1+15p)}{16(p+\bar{f})} \]</p>

					<p>
						This shows that, even though consanguineous marriages are very rare,
						a substantial fraction of diseases caused by recessive genes comes
						from such marriages if $p \le 0.1$. Consanguinity of the parents is
						one of the strongest kinds of evidence of recessive inheritance. On
						the other hand, if the recessive gene is common, the increased
						incidence with consanguinity is very slight. Cystic fibrosis of the
						pancreas appears to be due to a simple recessive factor, yet there
						is no appreciable rise in incidence from consanguineous marriages,
						because the allele frequency is so high. The parental-consanguinity
						rate is much higher for recessive traits where the gene frequency is
						low. Most recessive genes are carried concealed in the heterozygous
						condition. We can get some idea of the total number of such genes
						carried by normal persons through a study of consanguineous
						marriages. A study by Jan A. Book showed that about 16% of the
						children of first cousin marriages in Sweden had a genetic disease,
						and if diseases of more doubtful etiology were included the number
						rose to 28%. The corresponding figures for the control population
						with unrelated parents were 4% and 6%. Thus cousin marriage, by
						these data, entails an increased risk of 12% to 22% of having a
						child with a detectable genetic defect. Since the child of a cousin
						marriage has an inbreeding coefficient of $1/16$, we reason that a
						completely homozygous individual would have 16 times as many
						diseases, or approximately 2 to 3.5. This is the number of recessive
						factors per gamete (since a homozygous individual may be regarded as
						a doubled gamete), so the number per zygote is between 4 and 7.
						These figures are based on rather limited data, but they furnish a
						rough idea of the magnitude. The conclusion is that the average
						human carries hidden the equivalent of some half a dozen deleterious
						recessive genes that, if made homozygous, would cause a detectable
						disease. We can also estimate the amount of genetic weakness that is
						carried hidden in a heterozygous individual, but which would be
						expressed as invariability if he were made homozygous. Sutter and
						Tabar (1958 and earlier) found from a demographic study in two rural
						provinces in France that children of cousin marriages died before
						adulthood about 25% of the time, whereas the death rate from
						unrelated parents was about 12%. Thus, in this environment, cousin
						marriage increased the risk of death by about 0.13. Making the same
						calculations above (i.e., multiplying by 16 x 2) we estimate that
						the average individual in this population carries 32 x 0.13 or about
						4 hidden "lethal equivalents." We say "lethal equivalents" because
						one cannot distinguish between 4 full lethal genes and 8 genes with
						50% probability of causing death, or any system where the product of
						the number of genes and the average effect is 4. The data on human
						inbreeding effects have not been very reproducible. The large body
						of data from Japan shows significant heterogeneity effects from city
						to city. There is danger of confounding inbreeding effects with the
						effects of social concomitants of consanguineous marriages. For all
						these reasons, we cannot place too much reliance on the numerical
						values of the previous paragraph. It is also to be expected that
						what is lethal in one environment may be detrimental in a better
						one. In much of the world, there has been a substantial rise in the
						standard of living and a decrease in the death rate. This means that
						the number of lethal equivalents is decreasing. In Drosophila, where
						the measures are precise and reproducible, there are about two
						lethal equivalents per fly. About $2/3$ of the viability depression
						from inbreeding is attributable to monogenic lethals; the rest is
						the cumulative effect of a much larger number of genes with
						individually small effects.

					<h4>3.6 The Effect of Inbreeding on Quantitative Characters</h4>
					<p>
						We consider first a theoretical model that is applicable to any
						measurable trait, such as height, weight, yield, survival, or
						fertility. For initial simplicity, a single locus with only two
						alleles is assumed. The model is summarized as follows:
					</p>

					<div>
						\[ \begin{array}{cc} \hline \text{Genotype} & A_1A_1 & A_1A_2 &
						A_2A_2 \\ \text{Frequency} & p_1^2(1-f)+p_1f & 2p_1p_2(1-f) &
						p_2^2(1-f)+p_2f \\ \text{Phenotype} & Y-A & Y+D & Y+A \\\hline
						\end{array} \]
					</div>

					<p>
						In this model \( Y \) is the residual phenotype when A locus is not
						considered. Genotype \( A_2A_2 \) adds an amount \( A \) to the
						phenotype, and \( A_1A_1 \) subtracts an equal amount. (We could
						just as well assume that both genotypes add to the residual, or that
						both subtract; this model is chosen arbitrarily and for algebraic
						simplicity. The same result would be obtained in any case.) If there
						were no dominance, the phenotype \( A_1A_2 \) would be \( Y \).
						Under this circumstance, the amount by which the phenotype is
						changed by substituting an \( A_2 \) for an \( A_1 \) is always \( A
						\), which we can call the additive effect of the \( A \) locus. \( D
						\) is a measure of dominance. When \( D=0 \), there is no dominance;
						when \( D=A \), \( A_2 \) is completely dominant; when \( D=-A \),
						\( A_2 \) is completely recessive, or \( A_1 \) dominant; when \(
						D>A \), there is overdominance, the heterozygote having a higher
						phenotypic value than either homozygote. We now obtain an expression
						for the mean phenotype \( \bar{Y} \). This will be given by summing
						the products of each phenotype and its frequency. (Since the
						frequencies add up to one, the sum is the same as the mean.)
					</p>

					<div>
						\[ \bar{Y} = (Y-A)[p_1^2(1-f)+p_1f] + (Y+D)2p_1p_2(1-f) +
						(Y+A)[p_2^2(1-f)+p_2f] \]
					</div>

					<p>Which leads after some algebraic rearrangement to</p>

					<div>
						\[ \begin{align} &\bar{Y} = Y + A(p_2 - p_1) + 2p_1p_2 \cdot D -
						2p_1p_2 \cdot Df \\ &\bar{Y} = G - Hf \end{align} \]
					</div>

					<p>
						When \( G = Y + A(p_2 - p_1) + 2 p_1 p_2 D \) and \( H = 2p_1 p_2 D
						\). \( G \) is the average phenotype with random mating and \( G-H
						\) is the average with complete homozygosity. Notice that \( H \) is
						positive if \( D \) is positive. This equation brings out two
						important facts about the phenotypic consequences of inbreeding. The
						first is that in the absence of dominance \( (D=0) \), there is no
						mean change with inbreeding. This means that whatever the level of
						dominance, as measured by \( D \), the change with inbreeding is
						proportional to the inbreeding coefficient. As long as \( D \) is
						positive (i.e., the heterozygote has a larger phenotype than the
						mean of the two homozygotes), inbreeding will produce a decline.
						There are two possible causes of the inbreeding decline that is so
						universally observed: (1) Favorable genes tend to be dominant or
						partially dominant \( (0 < A < D) \), and (2) the heterozygote has a
						higher phenotype than either homozygote, \( (0 < A < D) \). Notice
						that the observation of a linear decline in a quantitative trait
						cannot discriminate between these possibilities, for it would be
						expected with either type of gene action, or any mixture of the two.
						To discriminate between them will require other kinds of evidence.
						The extension to more than two alleles is straightforward and will
						be given here. We shall consider the extension to more than one
						locus. Consider a model with two loci, each with two alleles. We
						shall let \( A \) stand for the additive effect of the \( A \) locus
						and \( B \) for that of the \( B \) locus. If there is no
						interaction between loci \( A \) and \( B \), the model is as
						follows:
					</p>

					<div>
						\[ \begin{array}{cc|ccc} \hline \text{Genotype} & & A_1A_1 & A_1A_2
						& A_2A_2 \\ \hline & \text{Frequency} & p_1^2(1-f)+p_1f &
						2p_1p_2(1-f) & p_2^2(1-f)+p_2f\\ \hline B_1B_1 & r_1^2(1-f)+r_1f &
						Y-A-B & Y+D_A-B & Y+A-B\\ B_1B_2 & 2r_1r_2(1-f) & Y-A+ D_B &
						Y+D_A+D_B & Y+A+D_B\\ B_2B_2 & r_2^2(1-f)+r_2f & Y-A+ B & Y+D_A+B &
						Y+A+B \\ \hline \end{array} \]
					</div>

					<p>
						If the \( A \) and \( B \) loci are independent and in gametic phase
						equilibrium, the frequency of any of the nine classes in the table
						is given by the product of the frequencies at the borders. We get
						the mean phenotype as before, by multiplying each phenotype value
						within the table by its frequency and summing the nine products.
						After simplification this leads to
					</p>

					<div>
						\[ \bar{Y} = Y+A(p_2 - p_1) + 2p_1p_2D_A + B(r_2 - r_1) + 2 r_1 r_2
						D_B - 2(p_1 p_2 D_A + r_1 r_2 D_B)f \]
					</div>

					<p>
						As before, there is a linear relation to the inbreeding coefficient
						(unless \( D_A = D_B = 0 \)), as might be expected from knowledge
						that this is true for either locus by itself. We now complicate the
						model by assuming an interaction between the two loci. In population
						genetics, the word <em>epistasis</em> is given a meaning broader
						than its classical meaning so as to include all levels of
						nonadditive effects between loci. Any circumstance where a
						substitution at the \( A \) locus has a different effect depending
						on the genotype at the \( B \) locus is an example of epistasis. A
						simple way to construct such a model is to add interaction terms to
						each value already given so that the phenotypes are now:
					</p>

					<div>
						\[ \begin{array}{cccc} \hline \text{Genotype} & A_1A_1 & A_1A_2 &
						A_2A_2 \\ \hline B_1B_1 & Y-A-B+I & Y+D_A-B-L & Y+A-B-I\\ B_1B_2 &
						Y-A+ D_B -K & Y+D_A+D_B+J & Y+A+D_B+K\\ B_2B_2 & Y-A+ B-I &
						Y+D_A+B+L & Y+A+B+I \\ \hline \end{array} \]
					</div>

					<p>
						Notice that there are nine parameters, \( Y, A, B, D_A, D_B, I, J,
						K, L \) which correspond to the nine phenotypes so there is a
						complete specification of the phenotypes when the parameters are
						given, and vice versa.
					</p>

					<div>
						\[ \bar{Y} = \sum (\text{frequency} \times \text{phenotype}) \]
					</div>

					<p>The formula for \( \bar{Y} \) may be written as</p>

					<div>\[ \bar{Y} = G - Hf + Mf^2 \]</div>

					<p>Where</p>

					<div>
						\[ G = Y + A(p_2 - p_1) + B(r_2 - r_1) + 2 D_A \cdot p_1 p_2 + 2 D_B
						\cdot r_1 r_2 + I(r_1 - r_2)(p_1 - p_2) + 2K \cdot r_1 r_2 (p_2 -
						p_1) + 2L \cdot p_1 p_2(r_2 - r_1) + 4 J \cdot p_1 p_2 \cdot r_1 r_2
						\]
					</div>

					<div>\[ M = 4J \cdot p_1 p_2 \cdot r_1 r_2 \]</div>

					<div>
						\[ H = 2[p_1 p_2 D_A + r_1 r_2 D_B + p_1 p_2 (r_2 - r_1)L + r_1 r_2
						(p_2 - p_1)K + 4 p_1 p_2 r_1 r_2 J] \]
					</div>

					<p>
						In this model, \( A \) and \( B \) represent the additive effects of
						the two loci, and \( D_A \) and \( D_B \) the dominance effects, as
						before. \( I \) is the effect of pure epistasis without dominance;
						in other words, the interaction of the additive effect of \( A \)
						with the additive effect of \( B \). \( K \) is a measure of
						interaction and dominance; it is the effect of the \( A \) locus on
						the dominance of the \( B \) locus. Likewise, \( L \) is the effect
						of the \( B \) locus on the dominance of the \( A \) locus. Another
						way of saying this is that this is the interaction of the additive
						effect of the \( B \) locus with the dominance effect of the \( A
						\). Finally, \( J \) is the epistatic effect of the two dominance;
						it is the interaction of dominance at the \( A \) locus with
						dominance at the \( B \) locus. From the equation, we can see that
						if all the terms involving dominance effects \( D_A, D_B, J, K, L \)
						are zero, there is no inbreeding effect since the coefficients of \(
						f \) and \( f^2 \) are \( 0 \). Thus epistasis alone, without
						dominance, does not produce an inbreeding decline. If \( J=0 \), the
						inbreeding change is linear in \( f \). In order for the coefficient
						of \( f^2 \) to be other than \( 0 \), there must be interaction
						between the two dominance effects. If \( A, B, D_A, D_B, K, L \) are
						all positive, then the genes with subscript 2 are associated with
						increased performance (or yield, or fitness, or whatever is being
						measured). This also generally means that the alleles with subscript
						2 will be more frequent than those with subscript 1. Then if \( J \)
						is positive there will be <em>diminishing</em> epistasis during
						inbreeding. By this, we mean that the curve is concave upward and
						that homozygosity for two loci reduces performance by less than the
						sum of the individual effects. Conversely, if \( J \) is negative
						(assuming \( H>0 \)), the epistasis is <em>reinforcing</em>. That
						is, the deleterious effect of two loci is more than cumulative. This
						is sometimes called synergistic.
